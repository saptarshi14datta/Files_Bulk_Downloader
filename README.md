Downloads entire file types from the internet. 


Eg: You want to download all lecture powerpoint all at once.

Simply input the file link
The file type (eg: .pdf, .pptx, .docx, .xls)
Paste the location where to download files
If the original link has sublinks (subfolders) where there are additional files, press "y" else "n".

That's all. You should be able to see all the file downloaded in your directory.
